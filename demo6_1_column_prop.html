		between two teams of 11 players on a roughly circular field, at the
		centre of which is a rectangular 22-yard long pitch. Each team takes
		it in turn to bat, in which they attempt to accumulate as many 
		runs as possible, while the other team fields, attempting to prevent
		the batting team scoring runs. Teams may bat once or twice each
		depending upon the format of the game. Each turn is known as
		an innings.</div>
